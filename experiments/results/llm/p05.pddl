1. Unstack b1 from b4 and put it down on the table.
2. Unstack b2 from b1 and put it down on the table.
3. Stack b1 on top of b3.
4. Pick up b2.
5. Unstack b3 from b5 and put it down on the table.
6. Stack b2 on top of b3.
7. Pick up b1.
8. Unstack b4 from b1 and put it down on the table.
9. Pick up b1.
10. Stack b1 on top of b3.
