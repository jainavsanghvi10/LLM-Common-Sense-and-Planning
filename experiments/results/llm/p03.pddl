Sure! Here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b1 from b3.
2. Put down b1 on the table.
3. Unstack b2 from the table.
4. Stack b2 on top of b1.
5. Unstack b3 from b2.
6. Put down b3 on the table.
7. Unstack b4 from the table.
8. Stack b3 on top of b4.

After following this plan, the blocks will be arranged as follows:

b4 is on the table.
b3 is on top of b4.
b2 is on top of b1.
