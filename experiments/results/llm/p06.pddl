Sure! Here is a sequence of actions to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b3 from b4 using the unstack action.
2. Unstack b4 from b2 using the unstack action.
3. Unstack b2 from b1 using the unstack action.
4. Stack b3 on top of b5 using the stack action.
5. Stack b1 on top of b2 using the stack action.
6. Stack b4 on top of b1 using the stack action.

This sequence of actions moves the blocks according to the specified goal.

Please note that this is just one possible optimal plan. There could be other valid plans that achieve the same goal.
