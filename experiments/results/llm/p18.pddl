Sure! To solve the problem, we can follow this optimal plan:

1. Unstack b1 from b9 (unstack b1 b9)
2. Unstack b11 from b8 (unstack b11 b8)
3. Stack b11 on b1 (stack b11 b1)
4. Pick up b9 (pickup b9)
5. Put down b9 on the table (putdown b9)
6. Stack b10 on b2 (stack b10 b2)
7. Pick up b7 (pickup b7)
8. Unstack b3 from b6 (unstack b3 b6)
9. Stack b3 on b7 (stack b3 b7)
10. Put down b7 on the table (putdown b7)
11. Stack b6 on b5 (stack b6 b5)
12. Put down b5 on the table (putdown b5)
13. Stack b8 on b3 (stack b8 b3)
14. Pick up b4 (pickup b4)
15. Unstack b1 from b4 (unstack b1 b4)
16. Put down b4 on the table (putdown b4)
17. Stack b1 on b4 (stack b1 b4)
18. Stack b8 on b11 (stack b8 b11)
19. Stack b7 on b2 (stack b7 b2)
20. Stack b10 on b9 (stack b10 b9)

This sequence of actions will achieve the desired goal, with each block in the correct position according to the given problem description.
