To solve the problem, here is an optimal plan consisting of a sequence of actions:

1. Unstack b6 from b3.
2. Unstack b5 from b6.
3. Unstack b7 from b4.
4. Unstack b3 from b7.
5. Putdown b3 on the table.
6. Putdown b7 on the table.
7. Putdown b6 on the table.
8. Stacking b1 on b2.
9. Stacking b5 on b3.
10. Stacking b6 on b5.
11. Stacking b7 on b4.

This plan achieves the goal configuration where:
b1 is on top of b2.
b2 is on top of b6.
b3 is on top of b7.
b5 is on top of b3.
b6 is on top of b5.
b7 is on top of b4.
