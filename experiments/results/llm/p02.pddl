Sure! Here's an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b1 from b3: unstack(b1, b3)
2. Put down b1 on the table: putdown(b1)
3. Pick up b3 from the table: pickup(b3)
4. Stack b3 on top of b1: stack(b3, b1)
5. Pick up b2 from the table: pickup(b2)
6. Stack b2 on top of b3: stack(b2, b3)

And that's the optimal plan! At the end of this sequence of behaviors, the blocks will be arranged as desired: b2 on top of b3, and b3 on top of b1.
