To solve the problem and achieve the desired configuration, an optimal plan can be created using a sequence of actions. Based on the given initial state and the desired goal state, the following sequence of behaviors can be followed:

1. Unstack b3 from b2: unstack(b3, b2)
2. Put down b3 on the table: putdown(b3)
3. Unstack b1 from b3: unstack(b1, b3)
4. Unstack b5 from b1: unstack(b5, b1)
5. Unstack b4 from b5: unstack(b4, b5)
6. Unstack b6 from b4: unstack(b6, b4)
7. Put down b6 on the table: putdown(b6)
8. Stack b4 on top of b6: stack(b4, b6)
9. Stack b5 on top of b4: stack(b5, b4)
10. Stack b1 on top of b5: stack(b1, b5)
11. Stack b3 on top of b2: stack(b3, b2)
12. Stack b6 on top of b2: stack(b6, b2)

This sequence of actions will move the blocks according to the desired configuration.
