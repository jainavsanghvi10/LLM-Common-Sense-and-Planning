To solve this problem, we can use the following plan:

1. Unstack b3 from b5
2. Putdown b3
3. Unstack b2 from b3
4. Putdown b2
5. Unstack b1 from b2
6. Putdown b1
7. Pickup b3
8. Stack b3 on b5
9. Pickup b1
10. Stack b1 on b3

This plan will achieve the goal of having b1 on top of b3 and b3 on top of b5.
