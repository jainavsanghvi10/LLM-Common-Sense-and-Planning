To solve the new planning problem, an optimal plan would be as follows:

1. Unstack b3 from b4
2. Putdown b3
3. Unstack b4 from b2
4. Putdown b4
5. Unstack b2 from b1
6. Putdown b2
7. Unstack b5 from b3
8. Putdown b5
9. Unstack b1 from the table
10. Putdown b1
11. Pickup b2
12. Stack b2 on b1
13. Pickup b3
14. Stack b3 on b5
15. Pickup b4
16. Stack b4 on b1

After following this plan, the blocks will be in the desired configuration where b1 is on top of b2, b3 is on top of b5, and b4 is on top of b1.
