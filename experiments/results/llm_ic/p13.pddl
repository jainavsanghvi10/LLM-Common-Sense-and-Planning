Certainly! Here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b9 from b2
2. Putdown b9
3. Unstack b5 from b3
4. Putdown b5
5. Unstack b3 from b1
6. Putdown b3
7. Pickup b2
8. Stack b2 on b5
9. Pickup b4
10. Stack b4 on b8
11. Pickup b6
12. Stack b6 on b4
13. Pickup b8
14. Stack b8 on b7

This plan satisfies all the goals and ensures that each action is performed optimally.
