Certainly! Here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. unstack b1 from b9
2. putdown b1
3. unstack b9 from b10
4. putdown b9
5. unstack b10 from b3
6. putdown b10
7. unstack b3 from b5
8. putdown b3
9. unstack b5 from b8
10. putdown b5
11. unstack b8 from b12
12. putdown b8
13. unstack b12 from b2
14. putdown b12
15. pickup b1
16. stack b1 on b6

This plan achieves the goal of placing b1 on top of b6, b5 on top of b3, b6 on top of b2, b8 on top of b9, b9 on top of b10, b10 on top of b1, b11 on top of b12, and b12 on top of b8.
