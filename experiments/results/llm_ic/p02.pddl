To solve the new planning problem, here is an optimal plan in the form of a sequence of behaviors:

1. unstack b1 from b3
2. putdown b1
3. unstack b3 from b2
4. putdown b3
5. pickup b2
6. stack b2 on b3
7. pickup b3
8. stack b3 on b1

Following this plan will result in b2 being on top of b3 and b3 being on top of b1, which satisfies the goal of the problem statement.
