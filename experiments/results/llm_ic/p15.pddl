To solve the problem and achieve the desired goal, an optimal plan can be as follows:

1. Unstack b9 from b4
2. Putdown b9
3. Unstack b4 from b7
4. Putdown b4
5. Pickup b2
6. Unstack b8 from b2
7. Putdown b8
8. Pickup b6
9. Unstack b8 from b6
10. Putdown b8
11. Pickup b3
12. Unstack b10 from b3
13. Putdown b10
14. Pickup b2
15. Unstack b10 from b2
16. Putdown b10
17. Pickup b1
18. Unstack b2 from b1
19. Putdown b2

Following this plan will result in b2 being on top of b1, b3 on top of b10, b4 on top of b7, b6 on top of b8, b8 on top of b2, and b9 on top of b4, satisfying the given goal.
