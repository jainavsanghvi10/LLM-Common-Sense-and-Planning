This repository contains the code and resources for our project that explores the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Classical Planners to enhance planning capabilities. The project focuses on bridging the gap between the strengths of LLMs, which excel in natural language understanding, and Classical Planners, known for their sound and complete logical reasoning.
